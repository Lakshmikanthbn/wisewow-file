### Final Steps

1. **Initialize Git Repository**:
    ```sh
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
    git push -u origin main
    ```

2. **Set Up Docker Hub**: Ensure you have a Docker Hub account and replace `<your-docker-hub-username>` in the Kubernetes deployment file and Jenkinsfile.

3. **Set Up Jenkins**: Ensure Jenkins has Docker and Kubernetes plugins installed, and you have configured credentials for Docker Hub and Kubernetes.

By following these steps, you will have a complete project showcasing your skills in setting up a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. Upload this project to GitHub, and you're all set!
